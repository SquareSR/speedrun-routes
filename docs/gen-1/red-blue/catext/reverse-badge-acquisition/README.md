# Red-Blue Reverse Badge Acquisition Routes

* [Charizard Route (Beginner Route)](charizard-route/)

## What route do I choose?
- The Charizard route is recommended if you're first starting out. It was previously the fastest route so it gets into all the glitched menuing. The route can still be used by beginners because it does not require the difficult starter/extended manips.
